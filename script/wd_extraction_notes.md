# Two Worlds II `.wd` Extraction Notes

## Overview

This document summarizes what has been learned about the `DLC3_PC_POL.wd` archive and the extracted decompressed blocks, with a focus on the `.eco` metadata and how the archive entry records are structured.

## Archive format

- The `.wd` file contains many zlib-compressed blocks.
- Zlib signatures seen: `78 01`, `78 5e`, `78 9c`, `78 da`.
- There are 231 candidate zlib signatures in the raw archive.
- 189 of those offsets decompress successfully using `zlib.decompressobj()`.
- The total concatenated decompressed stream length is approximately `4,439,848` bytes.

## Decompressed chunk structure

- Decompressed chunks are written as `DLC3_PC_chunk_<offset>.bin` files.
- Example chunk file containing `.eco` metadata: `DLC3_PC_chunk_00000030.bin`.
- Chunks appear to contain metadata records for archive entries, not necessarily the raw file payloads.
- The first bytes of `DLC3_PC_chunk_00000030.bin` look like a header followed by an entry list: `.W.. -LevelsCopies-\nowe\Level 1...`

## Archive entry record structure

Entries are detected by:

- marker byte `$` or `*`
- ASCII path string
- terminator `0x01 0x00`
- 20-byte footer after the terminator

The footer is parsed as:

- `type_id` = 2 bytes, little-endian
- `flags` = 2 bytes, little-endian
- `word1` = 4 bytes, little-endian
- `word2` = 4 bytes, little-endian
- `word3` = 4 bytes, little-endian
- `word4` = 4 bytes, little-endian

### Example entries

- `ActionSets\DRAGON_10_DEFAULT_TW2.act`
  - `type_id = 63944`
  - `flags = 1`
  - `word1 = 0x00000006`
  - `word2 = 0x14000005`
  - `word3 = 0x00000038`
  - `word4 = 0x0000001e`

- `-LevelsCopies-\Map_20_C02_NewAC2.bmp`
  - `type_id = 8440`
  - `flags = 1`
  - `word1 = 0x000000c1`
  - `word2 = 0x38000095`
  - `word3 = 0x00000400`
  - `word4 = 0x00000024`

- `Scripts\Campaigns\Missions\DLC_3.eco`
  - `type_id = 9952`
  - `flags = 62`
  - `word1 = 0x003e26e0`
  - `word2 = 0x010000bc`
  - `word3 = 0x05000000`
  - `word4 = 0x0000002a`

## Important observations

- The first 2-byte `type_id` field is very likely the file size for these entries.
  - For `DLC_3.eco`, `9952` matches expected payload size semantics.
- `flags` appears to be a file-type/attribute flag field.
- The remaining 4 words are not direct offsets/lengths within the same decompressed chunk.
- For `DLC_3.eco`, `word1 = 0x003e26e0` is too large for the individual chunk length, but it may point into a larger concatenated stream or a separate data area.
- Simple extraction using `out_data[offset:offset+length]` does not work for many entries because the metadata offset/length values exceed the chunk boundaries.
- Searching the concatenated decompressed stream for the path `Scripts\Campaigns\Missions\DLC_3.eco` returned `-1`.
- A raw `ECO` signature exists at position `4,402,305` in the concatenated stream.
- Plain UTF-16 text appears around offset `0x3e26e0` in the concatenated stream, suggesting the record may point into a broader data structure.

## Local files used for analysis

- `extract_wd.py` — current extraction script
- `inspect_wd_structure.py` — entry parsing and metadata inspection
- `debug_entry_decode.py` — field decoding for known entries
- `extract_analysis.py` — zlib block scanning and concatenated stream analysis
- `analyze_wd_entries.py` — field distribution and offset candidacy stats
- `inspect_chunk.py` — raw section inspection for a specific decompressed chunk

## Current limitations

- The exact meaning of `word1..word4` in the footer is not resolved.
- The path metadata is present, but the file payload location is not directly extracted from the decompressed chunk using the current record fields.
- `DLC_3.eco` payload extraction still needs a correct mapping from metadata to actual file bytes.

## Next likely steps

- Determine whether `word1` is a global offset into the concatenated decompressed stream or a different data segment.
- Investigate whether the archive uses chunk indices or a separate data table for payload storage.
- Scan the concatenated stream for the dynamic file data pattern and correlate with known entry sizes.
- Update `extract_wd.py` to translate metadata fields correctly before attempting file writes.

## Notes for AI models

- The archive uses mixed metadata and file payload data across zlib-decompressed blocks.
- Do not assume archive `offset` is always inside the decompressed block that contains the path string.
- Treat `type_id` as likely file size and `flags` as a small attribute field.
- The presence of `ECO` and UTF-16 text in the larger stream suggests mixed encoding and data layout.
- The extraction logic must be based on metadata mapping, not just local chunk offsets.
